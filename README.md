# Interfacing with lib gen

## Usage
`python libSearch.py [options] query`

query is a positional argument -> it dictates what you intend to search

`-h, --help` to get help
`-p, --pdf` to flag for a pdf (default filters for epub)
`-a, --author` to flag for querying authors

## TODO
Lots of things. This is very incomplete and still being worked on.
